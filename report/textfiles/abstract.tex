	The goal of this class project is to investigate the application of optimal control theory in attitude dynamics. In particular, we will focus on looking up time-optimal trajectories. Since there is no interest in any particular system, we use the dynamics for simple symmetric rigid-body. The problem of interest is to study the optimal control when the input consists of three controls acting on three orthogonal axis that where some norm of the control is bounded. The expected solution should be of bang-bang type.
